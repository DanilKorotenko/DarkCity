     INT.  BATHROOM  -  NIGHT

     SHADOWS DANCE  -  in and out of darkness.  A hooded light-bulb
     swings IN SLOW MOTION from the ceiling, its dim light REVEALS:

     A GLASS SYRINGE  -  broken on the floor.

     Clothes on a chair...

     Puddles of water on the floor...

     ANGLE ON SLEEPING EYES  -  Between waves of light they snap open and
     dart about in confusion.

     ON JONATHAN WALKER as he sits up.  Water splashes.  He's in a tub
     of long-cold water.  His neck aches like he's been sleeping forever.

     TIGHT ON WALKER  -  he's in his early thirties, dark featured.

     HIS P.O.V.  -  looking around the room.  Everything's strange,
     unfamiliar.

     He stands, steps from the tub.

     ANGLE  -  THE SWINGING LIGHT BULB.  Walker's hand ENTERS FRAME,
     stops the bulb mid swing.

     ON HIS REFLECTION in a cracked wall mirror.  He moves to the mirror
     and looks at himself.  A line of blood runs across his face, from a
     point between his eyes.  he wipes it away, and notices a tiny pin-
     prick wound on his forehead.

     WALKER'S P.O.V. PUSHES TOWARDS a circular window.  The glass is
     cracked, covered in grime.  His hand wipes it, this only smears the
     dirt, but the window is unlatched and swings open with a creak.

     It's dark out there.



     EXT.  BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     WALKER  -  from outside the window  -  ANGLE BECOMES A RAPID FLYING
     P.O.V. PULLING BACK in silence until the window is a SPECK on the
     side of a vast grey tower.


     INT.  BATHROOM  -  NIGHT

     Walker shivers, cold.  He picks up the clothes lying on the chair
     and puts them on.  Loose trousers with braces, a plain shirt,
     leather shoes with HOLES in both soles.

     Now he steps to the door, hesitates, hand inches from the doorknob. 
     He leans down.

     TIGHT ON HIS EYE  -  blinking through the key-hole.

     P.O.V. OF AN EMPTY ROOM  -  A glimpse of motion  -  the door across
     the room (leading to a corridor?) is shutting.
